4.These consists of four steps, first decide what kind of app that you want to create .

5.Now if you have an idea for an app you can tell to chat GPT about it and how it should work.

6.To make a small app like TIC Tac 2  lets go to chat GPT and ask it to give a HTML, CSS and a JavaScript respectively.

7.For script code for a two player Tic Tac Toe  , a game you can see that I got the code and now check if the code is working correctly or not , lets use a tool called codepen and click on start coding and here you can see Ive three different sections where you have to enter the HTML CSS and the Javascript code to Chat GPT respectively 

8. Go back to chat GPT then copy the HTML code and paste it then do the same for  the CSS and the Javascript code once I have pasted the code if I move this up and you can see I have a preview of my game so lets test it out as you can see the game is working completely fine but there are a few things that we can do to make it better . so first off lets improve how it looks so lets change the background color add a popup to reveal who the winner is and also add a button to restart the game so lets go back to chat GPT and ask to regenerate the code with the changes I want you can see the new version of my code so lets copy the hTML code then go back to code pen and replace the old code with anew one then do the same for  the CSS ad the Javascript code and youc an see that the background color has been changed now we play the game in a popup and it has a button to start a new game and it has abutton to restart the agme now if you want to add anyting additional to your game and make changes you can ask chat gpt to get the code and replace them okay so now that you have got the ode from chatgpt and tested it .

9.Now I can go to the next step which is to save my code to the computer first and I need to copy all the ocde in the notepad so lets open the note pad then copy the 
HTML code and paste it do the same thing for CSS and Javascript .
